## Mission statement
_Foster a culture that can bring socio-economic change for motivating fortunate members of the society to make a difference in the lives of less fortunate by helping them in affording necessary medical treatment -  fundamental need of a healthy society. Make our lives ‘saarthak’ by improving lives of others in need._

## Core Values
Our mission is based on certain core values that we not only cherish but use as our compass to help us get to the ‘True North’. 
### Volunteerism
We are a group of individuals joined together towards a common cause by spirit of volunteerism. While we don’t get any personal benefit from this organisation, we are here to make our lives ‘saarthak’ by getting the uttermost joy of completeness by helping poor and needy.
### Transparency
We understand the value of being transparent to the donors of this cause. Their trust is the foundation on which our efforts are based. Our donors decide in a democratic way how to spend funds. Additionally we make all the transactions including bank account statements available to all the donors. We eventually want to move to a system where everything is done online in an automated matter that can be easily traced for auditing and accounting purpose. 
### Impact
All the funds are used for the actual cause to make meaningful impact in lines with our mission. Our network of trusted and renowned doctors help us get maximum value for hard earned money of our donors by arranging for the treatment of needy patients in a cost-effective manner.  
### Efficiency
We have a small operational team with no overheads. This helps us take decisions quickly and move fast, We believe in high operational efficiency with zero bureaucracy. 
### Non-hierarchical 
We believe in a flat hierarchy. Hence we have a small team of highly motivated people and everyone has equal say in every decision. We all have trust and respect for each other but at the same time are willing to critically evaluate and if needed challenge every decision.
### Collective decision making
All our decisions are conducted through joint meetings, conference calls, group chats where every member participates as per their knowledge on the subject and then we take a collective decision. 
### Collective responsibility
Since we believe in collective decision, we also take collective responsibility for our actions. We understand our ethical boundaries and strive to adhere to them in every possible way.
